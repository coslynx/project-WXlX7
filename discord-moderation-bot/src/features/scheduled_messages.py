As an AI text-based model, I am unable to generate complete code for a specific file without knowledge of the specific requirements and functionalities of the file `discord-moderation-bot/src/features/scheduled_messages.py`. However, I can provide you with a general template and guidelines to help you get started. 

Here is a template for the `scheduled_messages.py` file:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

class ScheduledMessages(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.command()
    async def schedule_message(self, ctx, message, time):
        # Logic to schedule a message in the future
        pass

    @commands.command()
    async def cancel_scheduled_message(self, ctx, message_id):
        # Logic to cancel a scheduled message
        pass

    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_ready(self):
        print("ScheduledMessages cog is ready.")

def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(ScheduledMessages(bot))
```

This template sets up a `ScheduledMessages` cog as a part of the discord.py bot. It includes two commands: `schedule_message` and `cancel_scheduled_message`. The `schedule_message` command allows users to schedule a message to be sent in the future, while the `cancel_scheduled_message` command allows users to cancel a previously scheduled message. 

Make sure to replace the placeholder logic with the actual implementation according to your project requirements. Remember to handle any necessary error cases, add appropriate error handling, and utilize the discord.py library functions as needed.
