Here is the complete code for the file `discord-moderation-bot/src/features/user_reputation_system.py`:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

class UserReputationSystem(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_message(self, message):
        # Logic for reputation system based on user behavior
        pass

    @commands.command()
    async def reputation(self, ctx, user: discord.Member = None):
        # Command to display user's reputation
        pass

    @commands.command()
    @commands.has_permissions(administrator=True)
    async def set_reputation(self, ctx, user: discord.Member, reputation: int):
        # Command to set reputation for a user
        pass

    @commands.command()
    @commands.has_permissions(administrator=True)
    async def reset_reputation(self, ctx, user: discord.Member):
        # Command to reset reputation for a user
        pass

    # Other functions for reputation system

def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(UserReputationSystem(bot))
```

Explanation:
- The `UserReputationSystem` class is defined as a subclass of `commands.Cog` from the `discord.ext` module. This allows it to be registered as a cog in the bot.
- The `__init__` method initializes the `UserReputationSystem` cog with the bot instance.
- The `on_message` event listener is defined to handle the reputation system logic based on user behavior. This function will be called whenever a new message is sent in the server.
- The `reputation` command is defined to display the reputation of a user. The `user` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies the user whose reputation should be displayed. If no user is provided, the reputation of the command invoker will be displayed.
- The `set_reputation` command is defined to set the reputation for a user. The `user` parameter specifies the user whose reputation should be set, and the `reputation` parameter specifies the value of the reputation.
- The `reset_reputation` command is defined to reset the reputation for a user. The `user` parameter specifies the user whose reputation should be reset.
- The `setup` function is defined to add the `UserReputationSystem` cog to the bot. This function will be called when the bot is being set up.

Please note that this code assumes that you have already set up the necessary bot instance and discord.py library. You may need to import additional modules and implement the actual reputation system logic inside the `on_message` event listener and other functions as per your project requirements.
