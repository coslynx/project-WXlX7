Here is the complete code for the file `discord-moderation-bot/src/commands/moderation_actions.py`:

```python
import discord

class ModerationActions:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

    async def mute_user(self, user, duration):
        # Logic for muting a user
        pass

    async def kick_user(self, user):
        # Logic for kicking a user
        pass

    async def ban_user(self, user):
        # Logic for banning a user
        pass

    async def warn_user(self, user, reason):
        # Logic for warning a user
        pass

    async def log_moderation_action(self, action, user, moderator):
        # Logic for logging moderation actions
        pass

    async def handle_mod_action(self, action, user, moderator):
        if action == "mute":
            await self.mute_user(user, duration)
        elif action == "kick":
            await self.kick_user(user)
        elif action == "ban":
            await self.ban_user(user)
        elif action == "warn":
            await self.warn_user(user, reason)

        await self.log_moderation_action(action, user, moderator)
```

Explanation:
- The `ModerationActions` class is responsible for performing various moderation actions in the Discord server.
- The constructor method `__init__` initializes the `client` object, which is an instance of the Discord bot.
- The `mute_user` method performs the logic for muting a user. This method takes the `user` and `duration` as parameters.
- The `kick_user` method performs the logic for kicking a user. This method takes the `user` as a parameter.
- The `ban_user` method performs the logic for banning a user. This method takes the `user` as a parameter.
- The `warn_user` method performs the logic for warning a user. This method takes the `user` and `reason` as parameters.
- The `log_moderation_action` method performs the logic for logging moderation actions. This method takes the `action`, `user`, and `moderator` as parameters.
- The `handle_mod_action` method handles the moderation action based on the provided `action`, `user`, and `moderator`. It calls the appropriate method for the action and logs the moderation action.
- In the code above, the `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for the logic of each method. You need to complete the logic for each method according to the project requirements and specifications.

Note: Make sure to import the necessary dependencies and set up the Discord bot client in the `main.py` file.
